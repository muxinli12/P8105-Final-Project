# About
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system in New York serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey.

# Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted commuting and lifestyle patterns. Many people avoided enclosed public transit and turned to private or semi-private options. As an open-air, flexible system, Citi Bike offers a valuable lens to observe these shifts.

# Data Sources
[Citibike](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data): This data set provides comprehensive monthly downloadable files containing trip history for every ride taken. Key information includes trip duration, start and end times/dates, station names and IDs, bike type, and limited rider demographics like user type (Subscriber or Customer), gender, and year of birth. The data is processed to exclude short trips (under 60 seconds) and staff rides, making it ideal for analyzing riding patterns, station popularity, and geographical distribution of trips.
