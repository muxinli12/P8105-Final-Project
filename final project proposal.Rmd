# Motivation for this project

The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted commuting and lifestyle patterns. Many people avoided enclosed public transit and turned to private or semi-private options. As an open-air, flexible system, Citi Bike offers a valuable lens to observe these shifts.

# Introduction

This study uses Citi Bike data (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data
) from 2019–2020 to compare user behavior before and during the pandemic. By analyzing patterns across age and gender, we reveal demographic differences and insights for urban planning.

# The intended final products

**Interactive Dashboard/Visualization Report:**
Creating visualization web dashboards by Plotly and mainly focusing on comparison of 2019 vs 2020.

Key views will include: Dynamic Geospatial Flow Maps, Cyclical Behavior Heatmaps, and User Demographic Distribution Comparisons.

**Structured Analysis Report:**

A detailed PDF report covering the data cleaning process, key analytical findings, statistical evidence (e.g., significance tests), and customized recommendations for the Citi Bike operator or the NYC Department of Transportation.

# The anticipated data sources

**Primary Data Sources:**

Citibike BikeSharing Data for 2019 and 2020 (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)

**Secondary Data Sources:**

External Control Data: Time series data on NYC COVID-19 daily confirmed cases (for time-axis comparison) and concurrent weather data (to control for weather influence on ridership).

# The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**Geospatial Analysis**

`Dynamic Flow Maps:` Compare the most popular routes and hotspots between 2019 and 2020.

`Hexbin Density Maps:` Show where people rode most often, split by age group.

  1. `Distance Calculation:` Use the Haversine formula to calculate trip distance from station coordinates.

  2. `Data Aggregation:` Group latitude and longitude data into hexbin grids or regional areas.

**Temporal Behavior Analysis**

`Cyclical Heatmaps:` Compare ride frequency by hour and day of the week for 2019 vs. 2020.

`Animated Time Series:` Show monthly ridership trends by age group.

  1. `Time Features:` Extract hour, day of week, and month from the starttime column.

  2. `Time Alignment:` Make sure 2019 and 2020 time periods match for easy comparison.
  
**User Profile Analysis**

`Violin Plots:` Compare trip duration distributions across age groups and genders.

`Stacked Percentage Charts:` Show how the share of Subscribers vs. Customers changed, and how extreme trip durations shifted.

  1. `Feature Engineering:` Create age groups from birth year.

  2. `Behavior Metrics:` Define “commuter” rides (short, weekday) and “leisure” rides (long, weekend).
  
`Diagnosis & Recommendations`

`Correlation Analysis:` Check how ridership changes relate to daily COVID-19 cases and weather.

`Regression Modeling:` Run a simple model to measure the impact of COVID-19 on ridership while controlling for weather.
